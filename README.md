# FermionOperators
This module is used for building a package for numerical calculation on the spin-1/2 fermion system. For a fermion system, a general state |X> can be expanded by the [basis](https://github.com/HengyueLi/Fermion_Table#representation-of-manybody-state) {|ѱ<sub>i</sub>>}:</br>
|X> = Σ<sub>i</sub> |ѱ<sub>i</sub>>(1).</br>&nbsp;
A general fermion operator f can act on this state and a new state |Y> is obtained:</br>
|Y> = f |X>    (2)  </br>&nbsp;
 Here we define the concept of 'single operator' is a multiplication of c and c<sup>+</sup>, where c and c<sup>+</sup> are the creation and annihilation operators. For example c<sup>+</sup>,c,c<sup>+</sup>c,cccc... are all single operators and (c + c<sup>+</sup>) is not. We can futher expand f as a summation of 'single operators'.</br>
 f = Σ<sub>i</sub>A<sub>i</sub>.</br>
 Here A<sub>i</sub> the single operator and is what this module simulated. We can expand (2) by expression similar to (1):</br>
|Y> = Σ<sub>i</sub> |ѱ'<sub>i</sub>> = Σ<sub>a</sub>Σ<sub>i</sub> A<sub>a</sub>  |ѱ<sub>i</sub>>.</br>
We can conclude all we need is to calculate A<sub>a</sub>  |ѱ<sub>i</sub>>. </br>
In this module, all the usefull actions like: c, c<sup>+</sup>,c<sup>+</sup>c,c<sup>+</sup>cc<sup>+</sup>c...will be offered.

This module is strongly recommended to be used with [table](https://github.com/HengyueLi/Fermion_Table) object.
## example:

    program main
      use FermionOperators

      type(FermOper):: f
      integer       :: ns,optid,para(8)
      integer*8     :: psi1,psi2
      integer       :: sign


      ! In this example, we set the size of system to be 3.
      ns    = 3


      ! In this example, we test operator   c^+_i c_j
      ! The details of how to chose optid can be found in source code directly.
      optid = 3




      ! notice that the index of site is marked from 0 to 2 for this system ( ns = 3)
      ! In c^+_i c_j, we set i = { siteid = 0   spin = up  }
      para(1) = 0  ;  para(2) = 0
      ! In c^+_i c_j, we set j = { siteid = 1   spin = down}
      para(3) = 1  ;  para(4) = 1


      ! Initialization :
      call f%Initialization(ns,optid,para)


      ! We set psi1 = 50 for test
      ! |binary(50)> = |110010> = |010011(←)> = |0↑0>⊗|0↓↓>
      ! (see the meanning of '←' in https://github.com/HengyueLi/Fermion_Table)
      psi1 = 50_8


      ! we would expect that after f is act on psi1, the output state should be:
      ! psi2 = -|↑↑0>⊗|00↓> = -|110001(←)> = -|100011>=-|Octal(35)>
      ! notice that there will be a sign=-1 appear

      !  try it
      call f%act(psi1,psi2,sign)



      ! the output should be:
      ! psi2 = 35 , sign = -1   as we expected.
      write(*,*)"result is:"
      write(*,*)"psi2=",psi2
      write(*,*)"the possible sign is=",sign


    endprogram
